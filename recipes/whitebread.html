    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
       <li> 2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast</li>

        <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>

        <li>2 ½ cups warm water (110        degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>

        <li>6 ½ cups bread flour</li>

        <li>3 tablespoons lard, softened</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>


    </ul>

    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
       <li> Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water in a large bowl. Stir in 2 cups flour, lard, and salt. Stir in the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition. When the dough comes together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.</li>

        <li>Lightly oil a large bowl, then place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.</li>
        
        <li>Lightly grease two 9x5-inch loaf pans.</li>
        
        <li>Deflate the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough into two equal pieces and form into loaves. Place the loaves into the prepared pans, cover with a damp cloth, and let rise until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes.</li>
        
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        
        <li>Place bread in the preheated oven and lower the temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bake until the top is golden brown and the bottom of the loaf sounds hollow when tapped, about 30 minutes</li>
    </ol>
